# Next + Netlify Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ed50f56e-4fc2-4c98-8b66-1e5074c6f3d3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/next-starter/deploys)

This is an adaept [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v10.0.1 project for Netlify.

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Installation options

**Option one:** One-click deploy

**Getting Started:** Manual clone

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/peterennis/ae-next-netlify.git`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm run dev`
3. Make your changes
4. Connect to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)
